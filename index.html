  MaggieCoin is an early stage research project focused on digital assets and decentralized arbitrage. 
  Hot has three main LPs on Uniswap: ETH, USD, and SHIB. 
  This allows the asset to act as a market efficiency mechanism, by providing a vessel for arbitrage trading between the three assets. 
  Because Hot was entirely liquid from its inception, the asset will generally follow the price of the assets to which it is paired.
